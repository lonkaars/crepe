\brief Building game entities using a GameObject

GameObjects are the fundamental building blocks of a Scene. They represent entities
in the game world and can have various components attached to them to define their
behavior and properties. GameObjects can be created and modified within the
Scene, allowing for a flexible and dynamic game environment.
