# engine source

This folder contains the crêpe engine source files, unit tests, and some toy
examples. The only target built by default by the CMakeLists.txt in this folder
is the crêpe shared library object. Unit tests can be built by explicitly
specifying the target `test_main` when running the build command. Each source
file in the example/ folder corresponds to a CMake target as well.
